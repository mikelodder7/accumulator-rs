# Ways to contribute to Accumulator-Rs

- Bugs or issues: Report problems or defects found to the [Michael Lodder](mailto: redmike7@gmail.com)
- Features and enhancements: Provide expanded capabilities or optimizations
- Documentation: Improve existing documentation or create new information
- Tests for events and results:
    - Functional: Does the code work as expected?
    - Performance: Are there performance bottlenecks or issues?
    - Usability: Can the API be improved?
    - Security: Are there security concerns about the implementation in terms of constant time or edge cases?
    - Localization: Can the library handle arbitrary inputs besides ASCII characters like all UTF-8? Can the code run properly on various OS configurations with different locales?
    - Recovery: Does the code handle invalid inputs or operations and fail gracefully or crash or segfault?

# The Commit Process

When contributing code, please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and make your changes in a feature branch
- Include unit and integration tests for any new features and updates to existing tests
- Ensure that the unit and integration tests run successfully.
- Check that the lint tests pass

## Important
Use `git rebase origin/master` to limit creating merge commits. The easiest method for this is

1. `git fetch origin/master`
1. `git rebase origin/master`

Substitute `origin` with the necessary git remote.

## Signed-off-by
Each commit must include a "Signed-off-by" line in the commit message (`git commit -s`). This sign-off indicates that you agree the commit satisfies the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org).

## Commit Email Address
Your commit email address must match your GitHub or GitLab email address. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/.
